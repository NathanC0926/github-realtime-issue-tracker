    ```bash
    cd data
    for month in {01..03}; do
        for day in {01..31}; do
            for hour in {0..23}; do
                curl -O https://data.gharchive.org/2025-${month}-${day}-${hour}.json.gz
            done
        done
    done

    If your computer is trash, download fewer months/days/hours by adjusting the {0..n} range.
